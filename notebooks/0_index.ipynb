    "# Reproducible Builds for Quantum Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebooks in this repository are detailed step-by-step examples illustrating the concepts presented in the paper \"Reproducible Builds for Quantum Computing\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Leakage Using Non-Reproducible Quantum Circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "These three notebooks show the examples compromising the confidentiality of end users' data (see Sec. 5.1 and Sec. 6 in the paper).\n",

    "- [1_layout_stage](./data_leakage/1_layout_stage.ipynb)\n",

    "### Compromised Integrity Using Non-Reproducible Quantum Circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks show two different examples affecting the results of quantum computations (see Sec. 5.2 and Sec. 7 in the paper).\n",

    "\n",
    "Two additional notebooks are provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [1_qiskit_nondeterminism](./1_qiskit_nondeterminism.ipynb): The sources of nondeterminism in Qiskit that currently affect reproducible builds are explored here (see Sec. 8 in the paper) as well as a possible easy solution to produce reproducible quantum artifacts.\n",
    "- [2_paper_plots](./2_paper_plots.ipynb): This notebook contains the code to generate the circuits, submit jobs to the IBM Quantum Platform and generate the plots that appear in the paper."
